This project is a website for Desire, a discord moderation and server partnering bot that I have made. Most of my focus for this project was making it semi-easy for my friend to update content without having to do too much in the front-end. The website uses React for most of its functionality and SASS for its styling.

Currently I am working on the documentation page and more specifically, the search functionality. I have been able to do a fuzzy search that works pretty well, and I plan to go from the current printing results in console log to showing results below the search bar.
